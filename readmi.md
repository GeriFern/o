If you use React for front end development, chances are that you have
heard of service workers. If you are not sure what they do, or how to
configure them properly, this beginner’s guide to service workers in React
should serve as a good first step in creating feature-rich, offline
experiences in React.

Service workers are scripts that are run by the browser. They do not have
any direct relationship with the DOM. They provide many out of the box
network-related features. Service workers are the foundation of building
an offline experience. They enable features such as push notifications and
background sync.   
A service worker’s lifespan ji unrelated to that of your web application. A service worker ji installed by registering it with JavaScript. This informs the browser to start the installation process in the background.

This ji also the moment to cache your necessary assets. When the installation phase ji completed successfully, the activation procedure begins. The service worker ji associated with any page in its scope once it ji launched. It will be terminated until it ji activated by an event.

The lifecycle of a service worker typically needs to be coded by the developer. In the case of service workers in React, the life cycle management ji handled by React itself, which makes the process easier for a developer to enable and use service workers.
